Introduction:
Functions and arrays are important building blocks of JavaScript logic. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, while functions help in writing reusable and organized code. In this assignment, an array of student names is created, and JavaScript functions are used to display and search names dynamically on a webpage.


Objective:
To write reusable JavaScript functions.
To work with arrays and perform operations on array data.


Steps:
An array containing five student names is created.
A JavaScript function is written to display all student names in a list.
Another function is added to search for a student name from the array.

Expected Outcome:
A JavaScript program that dynamically displays and searches array data using functions.
